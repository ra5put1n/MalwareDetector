# Dynamic Analysis

## Feature Selection and Extraction 
A part of our code is used to extract several features from files such as API calls,Descriptions, etc with their counts in all files taken, which was used to get a general insight about the data. After a bit of analysis,we have decided to tokenise all our files(Malware and Bening) with Description strings being the column vector to generate a CSV file(Description.csv).We have used a set of all the Description Strings we get in Dynamic Analysis in set 2 and 3 of Benign and Malware File after we have even excluded numbers from strings for example which stated "58 Antiviruses" to "Antiviruses".

## Training and Output
Model with XGBClassifier which process on Description.csv and produces the final output csv file - Sumbission_Dynamic.csv.
